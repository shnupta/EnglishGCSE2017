# Reality of conflict

## Overview
- People experience loss when they're separated from someone of something they love
- An scarity of hope can lead to negativity and despair.

### Conflict causes loss of people or places
- #### Poppies
    - The mother feels like she lost her son when he joined the army. She acts as if he had died, she leans against the "war memorial" and mentions "Armistice Sunday".
    - The loss she experienced is emphasised by references to textures and the senses. She traces "the inscriptins" on the war memorial and listens for her son's voice "on the wind". This shows how desperate her desire to find a connection to him is.

- #### The Emigrée
    - The speaker is nostalgic of the place she left as a child, the opening phrase "There was once a country..." frames the poem with the sense of loss she feels fo the place.
    - The loss is heightened by the fact that the speaker retains an "impression of sunlight", a positive idealised view of the city.
    - There are suggestions that the conflict is the reason for the speakers loss, the city "may be at war", and the speaker describes herself as an "Emigrée" suggesting that she was forced to leave.

- #### Kamikaze
    - Although the pilot chose to avoid dying in the war, his family still lose him. Their shame causes them to treat him as if he "no longer existed".
    - The daughter's statment he "was no longer the father we loved" hints at the emotional pain that this loss caused both the pilot and his family.

### People without power often feel hopeless
- #### London

    - There is a lack of hope with a no sence that anyone can do anything to improve the situation.
    - The final image of plagued "marriage hearse" implies the cycle of suffering will continue.

- #### Exposure
    - The men in the trenches have no hope of things improving. The dejected line, "We only know war lasts rain soaks and clouds sag stormy" emphasises that their lives are miserable and filled with suffering.
