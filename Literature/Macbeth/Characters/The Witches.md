# The Witches

## They have supernatural powers
- The Three Witches are also known as the Weird Sisters. They look unnatural and evil.
- The Witches can see the future. They seem to act out of malice - they don't gain anything but they just enjoy causing trouble.
- They speak in short rhyming lines. It sets them apart from other characters. Lines like "Eye of newt, and toe of frog / Wool of bat, and tongue of dog" make them sound gruesome and evil
- Their line "Fair is foul, and fould is fair" shows that nothing is as it seems in the play

## They're evil, but they don't tell Macbeth to murder Duncan
- The Witches are typically accompanied by "Thunder and lightning" (pathetic fallacy) making the atmosphere dark and frightening.
- They make prophecies but don't explain how they take place. This takes advantage of Macbeth's "Vaulting ambition", and so they use it to control his actions.
- They predict he will be king - which pushes him to murder Duncan.
- They confuse Macbeth using paradoxes - for example telling him Banquo will be "Lesser than Macbeth, and greater". By not being clear about what the future holds, they keep control of Macbeth.
- They trick Macbeth by making predicitons that give him a false sense of security, such as "none of woman born / Shall harm Macbeth".
