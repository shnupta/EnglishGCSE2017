# Ambition

## Ambition is the main theme in Macbeth
- Ambition moticates Macbeth to commit terrible deeds. It changes him from a "valiant" soldier to a "dead butcher".
- The play shows that ambition is dangerous because it can quickly spiral out of control. Macbeth considers the morality of killing Duncan for a long time but doesn't hesitate about killing Banquo.
- Once Macbeth starts killing, he has to kill more people to get what he wants and to make his position secure. It shows ambition can make people ruthless and selfish.
- Both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are eventually destroyed by their ambition, so the play can be read as a warning against ambition that isn't balanced by reason or morals.

## Ambition is Macbeth's biggest weakness
- Ambition is Macbeth's "fatal flaw". He's a brave hero at the start - Duncan calls him "noble" and Lady Macbeth says he "wouldst not play false" to get what he wants.
- Macbeth's reluctance to kill Duncan shows that he's moral, but his actions emphasise how strong his ambition is - his ambition makes him act against his morals.
- It also makes him act against his better judgement. He knows that ambition often "o'erleaps itself / And falls" - it can lead a person to aim too high so that they fail and lose everything. This foreshadows Macbeth's own tragic downfall. By the end of the play, Macbeth has lost everything and he dies "abhorred tyrant".

## Ambition can be good or bad
- Not all characters are corrupted by ambition. It can be a good thing is motivated to help others rather than yourself.
- Malcolm and Macduff are ambitious for their country. They want to take Macbeth's selfish powers away for the good of the country.
- Banquo is ambitious for his sons once he's heard the Witches' prophecy. He wants them to be kings, but he doesn't act on the predictions in the violent way that Macbeth does.

### Key Quote:
"I have no spur / To prick the sides of my intent, but only / Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself / And falls on th' other."
