# Fate and Free Will

## Fate is the opposite of free will
- Fate is the idea that everything has already been decided, so people can't change what happens to them.
- Free will means that humans choose their own course of action, so their future is made up of the results of their choices.
- If it's fate that everything that happens was destined to, then it's not Macbeth's fault that he murders Duncan. If free will exists, then his own choices led to his downfall.
- The play raises a lot of questions, but Shakespeare doesn't make it clear whether it's Macbeth's fate to kill Duncan.

## You could say that Macbeth is doomed from the start
- At times, Macbeth seems to believe in fate. After he hears the Witches' prophecy, he seems to be happy to let fate take its course - he believes that "chance may crown me, / Without my stir" so he'll become King without doing anything to make it happen.
- Lady Macbeth thinks that Macbeth is fated to be King - "fate and metaphysical aid doth seem / To have thee crowned withal". Despite believing in fate, she decides Macbeth must act to make it happen.
- By the end of the play, Macbeth says that life is "a poor player / That struts and frets his hour upon the stage". He feels that people are no more than actors playing a part who aren't in control of their lives.

## Or that he acts out of his own free will
- At first Macbeth makes a deliberate choice not to kill Duncan after he's considered the options: "We will proceed no further". He carefully weighs up the pros and cons, which suggest that he's in control.
- Later, Macbeth acts on the Witches' prophecies despite Banquo's earlier warning that they're "instruments of darkness". Macbeth could do as Banquo does and accept the prophecies without acting.
- Some of the prophecies are self-fulfilling - Macbeth only acts because he fears his future, so he causes it to happen. This suggests that he has free will.
