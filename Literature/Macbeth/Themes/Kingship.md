# Kingship

## A king didn't have to be the old king's son
- In the play, Macbeth suddenly becomes King, even though he's not the heir to the throne. Duncan chooses his eldest son as his heir, but he makes Macbeth next in line after Malcolm and Donalbain.
- Macbeth wins the throne by killing the King and framing Malcolm and Donalbain. Gradually, other characters realise Macbeth is not a true king.

## Malcolm describes good rulers and bad rulers
- Duncan is an example of an ideal king - he's described as "gracious" and inspires loyalty in his subjects, who see him as a "most sainted king" and therefore the rightful ruler of Scotland.
- In contract, Macbeth is described as a "tyrant" because he rules selfishly, using violence. He's rarely referred to as "king" which shows that the other characters don't accept hiim as the true King.
- In Act 4, Scene 3 Malcolm describes good and bad kings:

| A bad king is... | A good king is... |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| "bloody / Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, / Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin / That has a name. | "king-becoming graces, / As justice, verity, temperance, stableness, / Bounty, perserverance, mercy, lowliness, / Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude" |
| Malcolm is describing Macbeth's reign above - he's "avaricious" because he's motivated by selfish greed. His lies make him "false" and "deceitful", and he's "bloody" because he uses violence to keep control over his people. | Malcolm could be describing Duncan in the speech above - Duncan shows "temperance" in his calm, peaceful manner, "lowliness" (being humble) in his gratefulness for loyalty, "justice" when dealing with those who betray him and "Bounty" in his generosity. |

## A good king should be holy
- Malcolm also says that a good ruler is holy - at the time, people belived the King was appointed by God.
- The King Of England, Edward, has a "healing benediciton" and uses "holy prayers" to cure sick people. He's surrounded by "blessings" that "speak him full of grace".
- In contrast, Macbeth is "Devilish" - he commits murder and talks to evil Witches. He's not chosen King.
