# Poetry in Shakespeare

## Shakespeare mainly uses blank verse
- Blank verse is a type of poetry that follows these three rules:
  - The lines usually don't rhyme
  - Each line has 10 or 11 syllables
  - Each line has 5 big beats 
  - E.g. "So __foul__ and __fair__ a __day__ I __have__ not __seen.__"
- Even in short, choppy bits of coversation Shakespeare usually sticks to five big beats a line. The words are staggered to show that they're all one line of poetry.
- For serious and important bits the rhythm is regular. Most of the characters are lords, and they nearly always talk in this regular rhythm - it makes them sound posh.
- The Porter, like most lower class characters, talks in prose and without much set rhythm. This sets him apart from the upper class characters and makes his speech sound more natural.
- Lady Macbeth talks in prose when she sleepwalks - her madness has made her lose control.

## The Witches always speak in rhyme
- They speak differently to others:
  - They speak in rhyme - usually rhyming couplets
  - Each line has 7 or 8 syllables
  - Each liine has 4 big beats
- The way they speak emphasises the fact that they are different to other characters - they exist outside of the natural order so they speak unnaturally.
- Lady Macbeth occasionally speaks in rhyme - usually to make two lines of speech sound more final or to emphasise that it's important. (Or is she the fourth witch...)

## Shakespeare uses different rhythms to show different emotions
- Shakespeare often changes the rhythm of lines by messing around with the punctuation and choice of words.
- This bit has steady rhythm. Duncan is making small talk with Banquo: "This catle hat hath a pleasant seat; the air / Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself / Unto our gentle senses"
- Here, the punctuation is very choppy and the rhythm is all over the place. Macbeth has just seen Banquo's ghost so the change of rhythm and short words show that he is scared and tense. "Why do you show me this? - A fourth? Start, eyes! / What, will the line stretch out to th'crack of doom?"

## Word order emphasises different words
- Shakespeare changes the word order to make important words stand out more. 
- The natural way to say "Macduff was from his mother's womb / Untimely ripped" would be to say "Macduff was untimely ripped from his mother's womb". but doing it this way makes the sentance build tension until the end.

## Soliloquies show the character's thoughts and feelings
- A soliloquy is a long speech by one character that is not spoken to any other character on stage.
- It's just them thinking out loud about their emotions, so it's a good way of showing the audience how a character is honestly feeling.
- Important soliloquies:
  - Lady Macbeth's speech to the spirits in Act 1, Scene 5.
  - Macbeth's speech about killing Duncan in Act 1, Scene 7.
  - Macbeth seeing the dagger just before he kills Duncan in Act 2, Scene 1.
- There are lots more though!!
