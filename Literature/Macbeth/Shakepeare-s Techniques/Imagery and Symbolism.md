# Imagery and Symbolism

## There are three kinds of imagery to look out for

### Similies...
- "I had else been perfect; / __Whole as the marble, founded as the rock__" - Macbeth is saying he was solid and grounded, like rock.
- "Now does he feel his title / Hang loose about him, __like a giant's robe / Upon a dwarfish thief__" - Here Angus compares Macbeth to a "thief" because he has stolen power from Duncan. Angus is saying Macbeth's responsibilities are too much for him, like the clothes are too big for him to fill.

### Metaphors
- "There the __grown serpent__ lies; the __worm__ that's fled / Hath nature that in time will __venom__ breed, / No __teeth__ for th'present"
- Here Macbeth describes Banquo as a snake and his son Fleance as a "worm". He still sees Fleance as a threat, and is afraid of his "venom"
- Snakes and serpents are used as an extended metaphor (repeated) throughout the play, usually to describe deception or betrayal.

### Personification
- "Life's but a __walking shadow__, a __poor player__ / That struts and frets his hour upon the stage / And then is heard no more."
- Here Macbeth personifies life, comparing it to a "walking shadow" and an actor whose influence is limited to his time upon the stage. This shows that Macbeth now thinks life is pointless and brief.
- "the earth / Was __feverous__ and did __shake__" - Here, the earth is personified as a person with a fever to show that Duncan's death was unnatural.

## Light symbolises good, dark symbolises evil
- Macbeth and Lady Macbeth both use images of darkness when they talk about evil deeds. They also use darkness to represent blindness and ignorance, and light to represent sight and knowledge.
- Macbeth realises that his intentions are evil - he describes them as "black".
- "Stars, hide your fires, / Let not light see my black and deep desires" - The Macbeths want to "hide" their evil thoughts and deeds in darkness - the murder of Duncan takes place on a dark, starless night when the "candles are all out". The darkness highlights how evil Duncan's murder is.
- "Come, thick night, / And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, / That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, / Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark".
- This is further reflected by the "strange" and "unnatural" events that take place after his death = "by the clock, 'tis day, / And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp". This image shows that darkness and evil (Macbeth) have overcome the natural goodness and light (Duncan).

## Nature represents the correct order of the world
- The way nature behaves shows the state of events - Duncan's murder disrupts the natural order. As well as "night's predominance", horses have "Turned wild in nature" and eaten eachother.
- Duncan's murder is symbolised by the image: "A falcon, towering in her pride of place, / Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed". It's unnatural for an owl to kill a falcon, so this emphasises the fact that Duncan's murder has disrupted the natural order of things.
- Plant imagery is used throughout the play - Duncan compares Macbeth and Banquo to plants that he will harvest. This image is continued in Act 5, Scene 2, but now Macbeth is compared to the "weeds" and Malcolm is the "sovereign flower". This contrast shows how corrupt Macbeth has become.

## Health and disease represent the state of Scotland
- Shakespeare uses images of disease and injury to highlight what Scotland is like under Macbeth's rule.
- Macbeth asks the Doctor to cure Scotland: "find her disease, / And purge it to a sound and pristine health". This is ironic - he can't see that he is Scotland's disease, and the country will only recover when he's dead.
- Macduff sees Macbeth's reign as causing injury to Scotland - "Bleed, bleed, poor country", "It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash / Is added to her wounds."
- Malcolm is later described as the "med'cine" that will cure Scotland, which reinforces the belief that he is the rightful king.


## Images of blood and water symbolise guilt and innocence
- Shakespeare uses images of blood to represent guilt - from the blood-stained daggers that Lady Macbeth plants on Duncan's guards to the "damned spot" that she imagines on her hands.
- The image of water is associated with washing away the guilt - Lady Macbeth claims that "A little water clears us of this deed", but Macbeth wonders whether "all great Neptune's ocean" would be enough to wash the blood (and guilt) away.
- Lady Macbeth's madness shows that she can't get rid of her guilt - she asks "will these hands ne'er be clean?" Cleanliness is linked to innocence here.

## Masculinity represents aggression and courage
- Shakespeare links the idea of masculinity to violence. Lady Macbeth bullies her husband into killing Duncan by questioning his masculinity: "When you durst do it, then you were a man." Macbeth uses the same tactic to persuade the murderers to kill Banquo, saying "in the catalogue ye go for men".
- Lady Macbeth prays to the spirits to "unsex" her - she wants female qualities like kindness and compassion to be removed. She rejects her maternal instincts, saying "take my milk for gall".
- We see another side of masculinity when Macduff learns of his family's murder. Malcolm tells him to "Dispute it like a man" (i.e take revenge) but Macduff says he must "feel it as a man" - he believes men should show compassion too. This makes the audience question whether violence is what makes a man.

## Everyday life can be disrupted by guilt
- Sleep symbolises a clear conscience - so lack of sleep suggests guilt. For a guilty mind, sleep brings "wicked dreams". After murdering Duncan, Macbeth worries that he'll never be able to sleep again. - "Methought I heard a voice cry, 'Sleep no more! / Macbeth does murder sleep'"
- Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking is a sign of her guilt - she can no longer sleep peacefully.
- It is also suggested that Scotland can't eat or sleep - being unable to fulfill these basic needs shows how badly Macbeth's rule has affected the country. - "Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights, / Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives".
- Clothing is symbolic too - at first, Macbeth is reluctant to wear the "borrowed robes" of the Thane of Cawdor. Banquo reinforces this, saying that the "New honours" are like "strange garments".
