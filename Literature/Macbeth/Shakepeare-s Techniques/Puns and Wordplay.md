# Puns and Wordplay

## They are everywhere
- Sometimes funny, sometimes just clever:
  - Malcolm: "There's __warrant__ in that theft / Which __steals__ itself when there's no mercy left." - __warrant__ can either mean 'justification' or 'arrest warrant', 'steal' can mean either 'to sneak' or 'to thieve'.
- The double meanings of both 'warrant' and 'steal' reveal why Malcolm and Donalbain's actions could be viewed as suspicious. They are running awau because they fear for their lives, but it could be interpreted as running away out of guilt.
- Shakespeare uses puns to reveal what characters are thinking. In this example, Lady Macbeth isn't making a deliberate pun - she's using 'crown' to mean head, but it shows her desire to become Queen is always on her mind.
  - "And fill me from the __crown__ to the toe topfull / Of direst cruelty"
  
## Shakespeare uses wordplay to create dramatic irony
- Macduff describes Lady Macbeth as "gentle" and says that the news of Duncan's murder would "murder" her.
- In Act 2, Scene 3, the Porter's wordplay creates dramatic irony. He jokingly refers to Macbeth's castle as "hell-gate" and talks about someone who is sent to hell for commiting "treason" - the audience knows that Macbeth has commited treason by killing the King, so the Porter's words are truer than he knows.

## Some charaters contradict themselves
- Shakespeare uses paradoxes and oxymorons to heighten the tension.
- The Witches' predictions are ambiguous. The things they predict seem impossible, and yet they come true. Macbeth describes their words as "lies like truth" - this is an oxymoron because lies are never truthful.
- The Witches' often speak in paradoxes - "When the battle's lost and won". This makes them very ambiguous - the audience doesn't know what their motives are, or whether they can be trusted.
