# Eva Smith/Daisy Renton
### Who was Eva Smith? No idea. Were Eva Smith and Daisy Renton the same person? Was she even real? No idea. What matters most is what Eva/Daisy represents, and what she means to the Birlings.

## Who was Eva Smith? 
- Eva Smith was one of Arthur Birling's employees, who was sacked for protesting against Iower wages This dismissal is the first in a chain of events that sees the Birling family tied up in Eva Smith's death.
-  According to the Inspector, Eva Smith changes her name to Daisy Renton and becomes a prostitute, which is how she meets Gerald and Eric.
- The real identity of Eva/Daisy is never revealed. She could be the same person, or different people who are treated as the same by the Birling family. They see one working-class girl as being the same as another.

## The Birlings take away all of Eva/Daisy's sources of income 
1. Factory worker at Birling and Company — she was a good worker but Birling sacked her for speaking up. 
2. Shop assistant at Milwards — Sheila got her sacked out of jealousy for Eva/Daisy's good looks. 
3. Prostitute and mistress to Geralad — he rescued from the life of a prostitute but dropped her when it suited him. 
4. Prostitute — she can't make a living this way after Eric forced her to have sex and got her pregnant while he was drunk.

## She never sought revenge, so the Inspector does it for her 
- Priestley has made Eva/Daisy a silent offstage character, so in the play she represents the silent, invisible and powerless members of society.
- Maybe Eva/Daisy didn't feel that she had the power  to make life difficult for the people who mistreated her. She was trapped by her situation.
- Inspector Goole speaks for Eva/Daisy and uses her as a symbol of the powerless working class to teach the Birlings about social responsibility and to make them realise their mistakes. 

## Were Eva Smith and Daisy Renton the same person?
- Gerald claims there were lots of different girls — "We've no proof it was the same photograph and therefore no proof it was the same girl." 
- But Gerald also says that Daisy Renton told him about having to leave a "job in one of the works here" after a strike and "something about the shop too" — so Eva Smith must be Daisy Renton. However:

	- The phone call at the end of the play confuses everything. Has Eva/Daisy just committed suicide? Was the Inspector a ghost come to tell the future?
	- Or is this a phone call about a different girl? The Inspector warned that everyone's lives are "intertwined", so the Birlings don't know how many lives they have affected.
	- Priestley makes sure that, even if you think you've sussed it, that phone call breaks up the girl's identity again.

## Eva Smith is a sort of everyman 
### The identity of Eva Smith is a kind of jigsaw portrait of an ordinary working-class girl, only you don't know if the pieces fit. 
- Take her first name. "Eva" — a bit like Eve, the first woman (so the Bible says) and symbolic of all women. 
- Take her second name — Smith. It's a very common last name, and it's from the word for a tradesman. 
- That's it — Eva Smith represents all ordinary, working-class women. 

## Eva Smith is central to the play's message 
- The inspector says that there are "millions of Eva Smiths and John Smiths still left" and that their chances of happiness are "intertwined with our lives".
- This is the key point — the Inspector is telling the and the audience, to behave responsibly towards others.
- So, although the focus of the drama is the group of five people sitting around the dining table at the beginning, the focus of the play is the life and death of an unidentified and unseen woman. If they all met different girls, it doesn't matter. Eva/Daisy is a mix of all the people they've ever treated badly.
