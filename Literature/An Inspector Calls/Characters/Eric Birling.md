# Eric Birling 
### Eric is a troubled soul. He has turned away from his family and taken up drinking. But no on to notice, or at least they think it's more polite to not mention it. So, instead, Eric's friendless and stuck. 

## Eric Birling is a troublesome son
- Eric's isolated from the rest of his family. He says that no one understands  him and he doesn't feel as if he can talk to any of them.
- Eric apparently forced himself on Eva/Daisy while he was drunk and got her pregnant. He was so drunk he didn't even remember it happening.
- Eric deeply regrets his actions — by the end of the play he says he'll never forget what he has learnt.

## Priestley drops hints that Eric isn't all right 
- Priestley's stage directions say that Eric is "not quite at ease". He's described as being "half shy" and "half assertive".
- He interrupts Sheila and Gerald when he "suddenly guffaws", but says he doesn't know why he's laughing. He finds things his family say funny, even when there's no joke.
- When Gerald says, "Unless Eric's been up to something," Eric acts suspiciously and seriously — "I don't think it's very funny," he says "still uneasy", and also answers "defiantly".

##Eric's been hiding some dirty secrets 
### Eric's drunkenness and bad behaviour represent the dark side of family life. 
- He's a heat'' drinker; and has been for a while. You can see his "familiarity with with heavy drinking" in the way he pours his whisky in Act Three. The rest of the family sees it too.
- He got a prostitute pregnant — his first encounter with Eva/Daisy results in her getting pregnant and there's a suggestion that he forced himself on her.
- He has stolen money from his father's business to support her. 

## Eric's not the only one... 
-  Eric meets Eva/Daisy at the stalls bar, which is exactly where Gerald met her, when he was looking for prostitutes.
-  Birling's 'respectable' friends go to the stalls bar to find women. The Alderman, Meggarty, even assaults young women in the town hall. They're all behaving badly. But no one says anything.
- It's a pretty murky world that these 'respectable' men inhabit. The play suggests Eric's behaviour is normal for a middle-class man. 

## He's the only one to have serious consequences 
- Eric's behaviour was not unusual — lots of men were doing the same... just in secret. Eric lacks self-control so his secret gets out.
-  His parents don't want a scandal. They don't care about him as much as they care about what other people will think of them.
- Eric's laugh interrupts the polite conversation earlier in the play. It's the same when his behaviour disrupts the polite middle-class illusion of respectability. They're all keeping up appearances — but Eric's making it obvious that there's something murky underneath.

## Eric is a villain and a victim
- Eric feels isolated and unsupported — he's had to find comfort elsewhere.
-  He shouts at his mother — "You don't understand anything. You never did. You never even tried —" and perhaps he's right. But he's really yelling. It might be the angriest moment in the play.
- He's the obvious villain of the piece, but he accepts responsibility for what he did — "the fact remains that I did what I did". He criticises his parents for pretending nothing's  happened — "You lot may be letting yourselves out nicely".
