# Sybil Birling
### Sybil's proud of her reputation and social status. She'll do anything to protect them, they are more important to her then the happiness of her children. Even when the Inspector's questioning her,

## She is proud of her class
- Sybil has traditional values. She strictly follows the rules, of etiquette because a good reputation for being polite will improve her family's status. These rules are more important to her than moral rules, the difference between good and bad.
- She has a strong set of beliefs about people's social status, which makes her prejudiced.
- To preserve her own status, she's prepared to be cruel, such as when she rejects Eva/Daisy's appeal.

## Mr Birling's "social superior"
###Sybil Birling is from a family with a higher social status than Arthur Birling's family. Even though Arthur's head of the family, Sybil is his "social superior":
- Sybil tells her husband off for saying the food was good in front of a guest. It wasn't polite to mention the cook or lower servants. Upper-class families would not say "Tell cook from me".
- Sybil's always reminding her family to have better manners. For example when she tells Sheila off for using slang.
- Sybil won't let anyone boss her around. She warns the Inspector, "You have no power to make me change my mind". 

## She lives by strict standards
- Sybil's social standards make her prejudiced against people from a lower class. She thinks that they have lower standards and can't imagine her son being involved with women "of that sort".
- It's her 'standards' that make her walk straight into the Inspector's trap when he asks her who she blames for Eva/Daisy's suicide.
-  Even though it was Sybil herself who reuse to help Eva/Daisy when she most needed it, she blames the father of the unborn child.
- Without realising it she condemns her own son and demands that he should be made to pay and to confess publicly. 

## She supports charity, but she is not very charitable
- Mrs Biding is involved with the Brumley Women's Charity Organisation which she says only supports "deserving cases".
- This gives Mrs Birling the authority to decide who's "deserving" and who's not.
-  She uses her "influence" to convince the other members of the board to reject Eva/Daisy's appeal because she offended by the young woman using the Birling name.
- She's outraged that Eva/Daisy would pretend to have the "fine feelings" of a higher social class, but Mrs Birling is unfeeling towards the women who make appeals to her.

## She dosn't change
- Mrs Birling is self-centred. She hasn't noticed her own son's alcoholism and dismisses her daughter's worries that Gerald lost interest last summer.
- She won't accept responsibility for her actions, and claims that she did the right thing, "I accept no blame for it at all".
- She doesn't learn from the Inspector's message. She only regrets not having "asked him a few questions" proving that she wants to be in control. 

## The stage directions show that she has made up her mind
### Even when her language is polite, her tone is severe and superior: 
- The stage directions say that Mrs Birling answers "haughtily", "very sharply" and "bitterly'.
- In Act Three, Mrs Birling repeatedly tells everyone that she'd already guessed it was a hoax. The script says that she "triumphantly" tells everyone she knew it all along. It's more important to her that she comes out on top, than that her actions could have caused a girl's suicide.
- In the final moments of the play, Mrs Birling is "smiling" and telling everyone to feel as "amused" as she is by the evening's events. These words suggest she has already put it all behind her.
