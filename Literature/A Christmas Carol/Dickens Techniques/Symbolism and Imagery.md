# Symbolism and Imagery

## Dickens uses symbols to develop his ideas
- Marley's chain was forged him "link by link" of his "own free will'. The fact that it's made out of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks and ledgers symbolises Marley's obsession with money and how that led him to selfishly ignore his "fellowmen".
- The children, Ignorance and Want, are clear symbols in the novel. They personify the problems caused by society's neglect of the poor.
- There are many symbols associated with the ghosts, for example: 
  - The "bright, clear jet of light" that shines from the Ghost of Christmas Past's head could symbolise the truth that can be found in memories. 
  - The Ghost of Christmas Present's torch, which it uses to spread good will, is a symbol of the transforming power of Christmas. He also wears a rusty scabbard without a sword, which is a symbol of peace. 
  - The dark shroud worn by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come almost entirely covers it. symbolising that Scrooge's future is ominous and uncertain. 
  
## Warmth and brightness symbolise joy and companionship 
- Throughout A Christmas Carol, images of fire and brightness are used as symbols of emotional warmth.
- Several of these images of fire and brightness are shown to Scrooge by the Ghost of Christmas Present. It shows miners "assembled round a glowing fire" and the lighthouse men's fire that throws out a "ray of brightness on the awful sea". All of these images use fire as a symbol of comfort and celebration.
- This idea is developed further when Scrooge and the spirit travel along the streets, they see the "brightness of the roaring fires" lighting up kitchens and parlours, and the "flickering of the blaze" that reveals preparations for "cosy" dinners. All these joyful scenes take place in the glow of fires.
- In contrast, Scrooge keeps his rooms dark because "darkness is cheap". He has "a very small fire" in his offices and "a very low fire" at home. The lack of warmth and light in Scrooge's life symbolises his lack of joy and companionship. 
At the end, Scrooge tells Bob to "Make up the fires". This is symbolic of Scrooge's transformation, and ie fact that he has learnt to understand the importance of showing kindness and generosity to others. 

## Music is an important symbol of celebration and happiness 
- Music is central to the Christmas celebrations at Fezziwig's party and at Fred's house, and Dickens also mentions the singing of Tiny Tim, the miners and the lighthouse men. 
- There's a strong contrast between the joy and happiness of Fred's "musical family" and the lonely, miserable Scrooge, whose life is without music (this is emphasised when Scrooge scares away the carol singer in Chapter One).
- Music is also shown to have a powerful emotional effect. When Scrooge hears some music performed by his niece (Fred's wife), he wonders whether if he'd been able to listen to it more, "he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands". Dickens is arguing that music is so powerful in creating happiness that it could've transformed Scrooge's life. 

## Scrooge's bed is a motif 
- The first ghost's visit begins at Scrooge's bed, and after the last ghost's visit, he's returned to his bed — when the Ghost of Christmas Past appears it draws back the curtains of Scrooge's bed, whilst the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come dwindles "down into a bedpost".
- A person's bed is a private place, so it's important that the ghosts' visits begin and end at Scrooge's bed — they want to access his most private thoughts and emotions. The bed is also a place that is associated with sleeping and dreaming — this emphasises the dreamlike, unreal quality of the visions shown to Scrooge, making it easier for the reader to suspend their disbelief. 

## Weather reflects Scrooge's character and emotions 
- Throughout the first chapter, Dickens emphasises the fog and cold that surrounds Scrooge. The fog is shown "pouring in at every chink and keyhole", whilst the weather is described as "cold, bleak, biting". The weather is symbolic of Scrooge's cold-hearted isolation. 
- Scrooge is described as carrying "cold within him", and his presence "iced his office". Scrooge's cold  and bitter personalty is presented as being more powerful than the weather — the narrator explains "No warmth could warm, nor wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he".
- In the final chapter, the weather becomes a symbol of Scrooge's transformation. The fog has gone, symbolising how Scrooge has had his eyes opened and can clearly see those around him. The weather is "clear, bright, jovial, stirring", and the cold is "piping for the blood to dance to", which represents Scrooge's new brightness and enthusiasm for life.
